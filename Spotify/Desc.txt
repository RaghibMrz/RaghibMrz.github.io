Not-So-Sombre: Happy-Sad Songs, dedicated to that one person, who momentarily makes you believe, that things are actually okay; and though this conjecture may inevitably be false, atleast we can rejoice at the fact that there exists a soul that can, just for a moment, make us forget our sorrows.

Sombre: Because who likes happy music anyway? Why not listen to understand, to contemplate, ponder some pervasive thoughts of how people will always let you down and love doesn't really exist. But that's okay, even if we are alone, alteast we can philosophise perfect ideals and find peace within ourselves.
